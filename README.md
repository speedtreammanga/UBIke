# UBIke ðŸš²
This small project was made for Ubisoft Montreal as a "test" app.

This app does not communicate with any APIs. This mean that any changes you make during a session will be _erased_ on refresh as _nothing is saved_.

## Getting started
1) Install node & npm:
* Follow [this guide](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node)
2) Install the dependencies:
* Run `npm i`
3) Run the app in the browser:
* Run `npm start`. This will build the project with Webpack and then run it via _webpack-dev-server_.

## Tests
To run the unit tests, simply run `npm run test`
